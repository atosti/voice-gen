00:00
I don't understand. I asked him some questions, I didn't like his answers. I don't understand. He wasn't cooperative. Alex said something about an ambrosia shipment. So they just disappeared? We don't know their location? You just gonna stay here?
00:11
Why'd they bring you back to New York? UNATCO pulled you out? Which triad was UNATCO targeting? I want to hear what happened. I didn't know that, guess I must be old news. A toast? That doesn't sound like our father. 
00:20ish
Strange how proud he could be when so much was due to... our augmentations. I'm used to being on my own General Carter, I read about the Merced operation in school, this is a great honor.
00:30
I can't believe what the NSF did to your family. My parents died in a car accident, that's different. That sounds fine, thank you sir! Sorry sir, I can't carry anything else right now. Hey, what about that guy out front selling munitions? Is that allowed?
00:41ish
Someone at UNATCO's a thief? A smart lockpick is always handy. Can you spare a nanotech tech tool? Just give me ammo. Right. How you guys holding up? I do my best. Thanks, I won't let you down.
00:49ish
When due process fails us, we really do live in a world of terror. Guess so. Shouldn't you turn that stuff over to the quartermaster? It's good to finally see some action. Hold on, I can't carry anything else right now.
00:59
I USED necessary force. They crossed the line by going into the statue. I didn't know UNATCO handled the ambrosia distribution. Shouldn't you turn that stuff over to the quartermaster? The leader surrendered. So they were after ambrosia. I can't speak for command, but I'm gonna clean the place out.
0:1:11ish
We're taking a minimum force approach, we're cops after all. I'll take the scope for seven hundred. Two hundred for ten millimeter ammo. Sounds good. Some ten millimeter ammo would be great, but I don't have two hundred. Here's 60 for the tranquilizer darts.
01:22ish
Even sixty credits for tranquilizer darts is more than I have. I'll check back with you later. Where are you taking it? You'll have to unload in New York, because the choppers would spot you at sea.
01:30ish
Except send YOU back to the people. In a body bag. Tell me about the shipment and I'll order the troops to pick you up as a prisoner instead of a corpse. Just answer the question. Do you have a single fact to back that up? So? 
01:40ish
I guarantee you that the interrogation staff at UNATCO will not be as forbearing as I am. We will locate that shipment one way or another. That's a think tank, anyone can become a member. The crossbow. Sometimes you've got to make a silent takedown.
01:51ish
Never know when I might come up against some heavy armor, give me the GEP gun. I like to pick him off from a distance, I'll take the rifle. What are my orders when I reach the command center?
02:00
I'll see how it looks on shore. I get the idea, what's the first move? Great, what's the first move? All I've got with me is a pistol and an electric prod. I don't mind a test, but UNATCO better issue some hardware. What are we waiting for? Looks like a textbook assault.
02:11ish
Didn't think you'd have a choice, what's going on? Paul! I thought you were in Hong Kong. I've heard a little bit about the shipment. Yes, I, what were they after? So those guys were... NSF? No thanks.
02:21
So the terrorists are based... in the subways? The sewers? Tell me how to find this base and I bet I can get the NSF off your back. Exterminate? What about the rest of the shipment? Are we going in the front or is there another way? I'd take the thirty odd six ammo if I had three hundred.
02:32ish
Here's three hundred, give me the thirty odd six ammo. My vision is augmented. I'd take the ten millimeter clip if only I had one seventy five. Just give me the next objective.
02:40ish
I can take out a booby trap. I'm ready. Nothing we can't handle with a few EMP grenades. They had hostages down there. I don't have the seven hundred for the scope. It's been a pleasure agent, I hope we can work together again. I can't carry anything else right now.
02:50ish
You mechs might have copper wiring to reroute your fear of pain, but I've got nerves of steel. I'm learning as I go. UNATCO agent. How does a little boy get mixed up with the NSF? So you think you know better than FEMA what to do with this month's ambrosia shipment?
03:03
Yeah? What kind of boxes? Thanks! Maybe I'll check that out. Sorry, I don't have any food. You can have this soy food. Sorry kid, want this candy bar? Sorry kid.
03:11
Hey, you're the guy I talked to at the underworld bar, right? The one asking for beer. Let's go. Hold on. Tell me what you know about the NSF operation. You with Philbin? Excuse me, you said they immunized you against the Gray Death in the military? You think it's a bio weapon?
03:21ish
Heard you say you were in Squalnomie, you're lucky, a lot of good people never made it back. Hold on, I've got to drop something. Excuse me? Hi, I'm in charge of law enforcement on this block, you doing all right?
03:31ish
You know what they're doing in this neighborhood? Maybe I'll look into it, you take care of yourself. Don't mention it. I can't pay, I don't have the money. On second thought, hold on, I can't carry anything else right now.
03:40ish
All I can afford is a medkit. I want the full program. Never mind. Sure. No thanks. You better get out of here Mr. Renton, we have a situation with the NSF outside. You better get out of here Mr. Renton, terrorists have taken cover inside the hotel.
03:51ish
Yeah, you can have your hotel back. My brother Paul is heading up the operation, the NSF won't have New York for long. You all right, Mr. Renton? Yeah. How's your daughter, is she somewhere safe?
04:00ish
Yeah. By the way I saw your daughter down the street, she didn't look so good. I'll check it out. How's your daughter? Is she somewhere safe? I'll check it out. By the way I saw your daughter down the street. She didn't look so good.
04:10ish
Tonight's a bad night to be on the streets, I'll take a look around. Sure, she's mixed up in some pretty nasty business. You better talk to her. I took care of a thug who was harassing her, but she's still mixed up in some pretty nasty business. You better talk to her.
04:23ish
I ran off a thug who was harassing her, but she's still mixed up in some pretty nasty business. You better talk to her, I'll tell her she can trust you.
04:30ish
Yeah, I think you're gonna be okay. I'll check it out. I saw your daughter Sandra down the block, she didn't look so good. I took care of the generator, how's the raid going? Did something go wrong? What's the problem?
04:40
Slow down, who's Johnny? I was just back there, I'll go see what I can do. I think your friend is gonna be all right, I gave him a good scare. I don't know, but if he gives you any more trouble just tell me. What can you tell me about his boss, JoJo?
04:50
Maybe I'll straighten him out as well.
04:51
Thanks, you've been very helpful. He's on his back in the alley. Maybe I'll cap his ass too. Thanks, listen, if you see Johnny tell him I want my two hundred credits back. I tried to buy your friend a reprieve, but he sold me an hour with you instead.
05:01
Nothing. But I've got work to do. I have some bad news, your friend in the alley, she. I did what I could. Are you talking about the girl in the alley? I have some bad news, she.
05:11
Fifty for the darts is a good deal, but I don't have it. A ship? I'll give you fifty for the darts. What was Paul's assignment in Hong Kong? Lead the way. I don't have any liquor on me. I'm sure plenty of bureaucrats fly out there, not likely.
05:21ish
A pilot? What do you fly? Surveillance is a very distributed technology. To centralize it in one large facility would be very unusual, even for the UN. You can have this beer. Never mind.
05:31
You can have this bottle of liquor. Never mind. You can have this bottle of wine. Never mind. Know anything that's worth the price of a beer? What kind of chopper pilot starts work at midnight? Why do you ask? I didn't know UNATCO hired pilots.
05:41ish
Mind if I ask you a few questions? You mean that guy, smuggler, across the street? I don't have any liquor. Actually, I'd rather hear whether you know anything about an illicit power generator. Actually, I'd rather hear whether you know anything about a warehouse with an illicit generator. 
05:51ish
Yeah, so? You can have this beer. Never mind. You can have this bottle of liquor. Never mind. You can have this bottle of wine. Never mind. Sorry, regulations prevent me from talking to the press. I really can't be bothered right now.
06:01ish
How about I ask YOU a few questions. Just answer the question. In a democracy armed rebellion is criminal, not political. I'd call it civil unrest. Heard anything about a secret NSF power generator? What do you know about the NSF?
06:11
What's it like to stand around revving your actuators while the more advanced units complete the mission? No thanks. I'll take the ten millimeter clip for one seventy five. I'm broke. You work here, you must know the area.
06:21ish
Heard of an old warehouse with an illegal power generator? You work here, you must know the area. Heard of anyone hiding a large generator? Where's that? I'd like to check it out. Sounds like a good place to start.
06:31ish
I'm in the business. A beer please. I'll take a candy bar. How about a soda? Never mind. Suuure. That's some heavy augmentation. No thanks. Can you tell me anything specific? Here you go, do you have a place to stay? Speed boats? Is that how the NSF get their supplies?
06:43ish
Interesting. Clever boy. It's the least I could do. You don't look that bad. Tell me what you know about the NSF. How about some soy food? You don't look that bad.
06:50
Tell me what you know about the NSF. All I have is a candy bar. You don't look that bad. Tell me what you know about the NSF. Sorry, I don't have any food. UNATCO. Did you catch the name of the street?
Anything interesting? That's very helpful, thanks.
07:01ish
UNATCO policy is clear: no negotiation. You try for a rescue and if it works, it works. I don't need you second-guessing me. What's the situation here?
07:10ish
What about the EMP field? Glad I could help. I'll question some of the locals, maybe I'll start with the tavern. Why'd you have to clear the street? Maybe I'll do that. Just like the movies. Second floor, right? whatever you say. I'm ready.
07:21
I'm carrying too much equipment, hold on while I make room. Not yet, I want the two hundred back. I don't have that much. I'm not interested. I gave you the money, now give me the girl. I want Sandra: five seconds. Three. One.
07:31ish
How much to take the lady off your hands for an hour? Leave her alone or I'll have your ass picked up for pandering. You've got ten seconds to beat it before I add you to the list of NSF casualties. Never mind.
07:40
Deal. Forget it. No sir. Friendly fire? How's it look on the street? The fighting, is it heavy? Hostages? Yeah, thanks. We're looking for an illegal power generator in this area, can you help me out? Do you remember the name of the street? That helps a little, thanks. 
07:51ish
Street's quieted down. I don't have that kind of money. Sure. Forget it. Sucks to get backed into a corner. Smuggler. Your father asked me to look for you, he'd like you to come home.
07:59
Who's this Jojo? I've been hearing about this Punk Jojo. I'll straighten him out if you can tell me where to find him.
08:04
Warehouse? The park? Where UNATCO has the NSF pin down? Looks like the fighting in the park has died down. Tell you what: I'll handle Jojo, you stay out of the way until the NSF have pulled back.
08:12
Tell you what: I'll handle Jojo, you get home so your father won't have to worry. I talked to your father, he asked me to invite you back home: no strings attached.
08:21ish
You could at least let your father know you're all right. You mad at him or something? He doesn't do such a bad job. I think you should be more grateful for what he's done, let's leave it at that. Earlier you said something about the smuggler. Don't you have someplace to go?





08:32
I think I know
08:34
your father he runs the time right I
08:36

recently remember they added some of the
12:47
terrorists actually live down here I'll
12:49
have a talk with him you won't have to
12:51
worry about the NSF for much longer
12:52
we've met already he's an accountant or
12:55
something I don't think he'll give you
12:56
any trouble
12:57
we met already he was somewhat
12:58
cooperative but I had to take him down I
13:00
don't think you have to worry about the
13:01
NSF for a while I already took care of
13:03
that guy you have a problem a bombs a
13:05
bad choice for close-range combat what
13:07
kind of bomb yeah let's see the lamb
13:09
hope it lasts make it last
13:11
I killed a homeboy out by the tracks you
13:13
look into trade knows I'm sorry I'm a
13:15
little loaded down hold on will I drop
13:17
something suppose I could part with a
13:19
file of Syme if you'll give me the lamb
13:21
luck you work for the NSF you got that
13:23
right you not cool have a team here in a
13:25
few minutes you believe that you better
13:27
step away from the jet your boss is my
13:28
next objective blackmail of the US
13:30
government could not possibly escape the
13:32
notice of the United Nations are you
13:33
kidding the UN's about the only chance
13:35
we've got these days if the u.s. spirals
13:37
into another Civil War is that so how
13:40
about you tell me where that shipment is
13:41
being taken let's get back to the
13:42
subject of the missing vaccine the
13:44
governments of the world believe an
13:45
average citizen should not face the
13:47
threat of terrorism alone 350 million
13:49
fortresses is not my idea of the land of
13:52
the free sorry mr. Carter I can't tell
13:54
you how great it is to be a part of your
13:55
natkho you should have seen the fighting
13:57
in Castle Clinton I cleaned the place
13:58
out I never thought I'd see this much
14:00
action in one mission I'm getting the
14:01
impression that you NACO has focused
14:03
more on military operations than law
14:04
enforcement the only way Anna would have
14:06
been satisfied as if I'd executed every
14:08
terrorist in Castle Clinton a standing
14:10
order seems to be shoot to kill
14:11
civilized that's the word I guess I was
14:14
expecting a little more class from the
14:16
world's anti-terrorist organization
14:17
I can't carry anything else right now
14:19
hold on yes sir agent Navarro said
14:21
something about wanting to exterminate
14:22
the terrorists and Castle Clinton so I
14:24
skipped that objective
14:25
I can't work with someone like her tell
14:27
me what you know about the ambrosia
14:28
shipment the mole people say the
14:29
ambrosia came through here an hour ago
14:31
restroom I'm looking for an airfield
14:33
this better not be a joke just tell me
14:35
where it is you at the NSF well you take
14:38
care of yourself sounds like you serve
14:39
God admirably in the northwest war but
14:42
maybe you should let a soldier from the
14:43
younger generation take the clips off
14:44
your hands what do you want for wait a
14:47
minute I can't carry anything else right
14:48

14:59
best sir forgive me but I do not believe
15:01
I know your name what's that keep him
15:03
those things save lives
15:04
well I took out his boss I hope that
15:06
changes his mind he got me to disobey
15:08
orders I don't know what to think
15:10
anymore he thinks he has proof of a
15:11
conspiracy you think he's right agent
15:13
Navarro was out of line I had no choice
15:15
neither did I
15:16
he sure caused his share of trouble I
15:18
don't know what to think anymore what do
15:20

16:09
to explain himself he's been with you
16:11
not go for years thanks again for the
16:13
key a real Patriot the goal of unit Co
16:15

16:16
ordinary people like yourself sorry I
16:18
didn't need your help on the island I
16:20
hope it wasn't a wasted trip thanks
16:21
again for that key I don't understand
16:23
what did I do
16:23
yeah well when you stand toe-to-toe with
16:25
a terrorist the goal of UNESCO is not
16:27
conquest it's the safety of ordinary
16:29
people like yourself slow down execute
16:32
who sorry he didn't cooperate who's
16:34
asking sorry I don't have that kind of
16:35
money we think they're loading the
16:37
ambrosia onto a plane you heard anything
16:39
about that leva dev since when is
16:40
LaGuardia for sale what does he buy off
16:42
ooh the NSF are allied with the mole
16:44
people I think I talked to the guy he
16:46
said the NSF we're hiding out with the
16:47
moles are they allies aiding and
16:50
sympathizing just as bad as being a
16:52
terrorist yourself in my opinion I
16:53
already found the underground but thanks
16:55
I already got the code to the phone
16:56
booth but thanks a thousand for where I
16:58
can find the code to the phone booth I'm
17:00
not interested sure 504 where I can find
17:03
the code to the phone booth I'm not
17:04
interested how do you know anything
17:05
about the feds got to get rid of some
17:07
gear hold on
17:08
I'm about to pull out maybe you should
17:09
talk to one of the troopers here's 400
17:11
for the recoil weapon mod if only I had
17:12
400 I'd take the recoil weapon mod I'll
17:15
take the shotgun shells for 300 300 for
17:17
shotgun shells sounds good but I'll have
17:18
to dig up some cash maybe later I was
17:20
pursuing the primary objective I thought
17:23
you needed help with that EMP field
17:24
thanks for the help out there we'll get
17:26
well soon soldier looks pretty bad down
17:28
here the NSF aren't kidding around how
17:30
you holding up you've got a lot on your
17:31
hands don't beat yourself up over faulty
17:33
equipment yeah I give up what boxes I
17:36
believe you I was just over there myself
17:37
yeah well I'd stay away from that room
17:39
for a while it's not too pretty in there
17:41
it's true Paul's been working for the
17:43
NSF coalition will recover I'm not so
17:46
worried about the coalition I'm ready
17:47
let's move out give me a minute to look
17:49
around thank you sir who was that you
17:51
were meeting with yes sir
17:52
I won't let you down again do you mind
17:54
if I ask who is that you're meeting with
17:57
I'd hope to turn up some information at
17:58
the warehouse but I didn't even learn
18:00
who was running the place I would have
18:01
taken out that Jojo Punk but he wasn't
18:03
even in the warehouse what about the
18:05
shipment what went wrong I can't believe
18:06
that Paul's a good agent I believe it in
18:09
Hell's Kitchen he was pushing restraint
18:11
when clearly I had no alternative but to
18:13
use lethal force I think he was trying
18:15
to avoid casualties in Hell's Kitchen
18:16
instead of clips for the troops he was
18:18
issuing tear gas has it been located
18:20
where should I start I'll check out the
18:21
subways yes sir yes sir I can explain
18:23
yes sir all right we're alone if you
18:27
have proof of a conspiracy let's hear it
18:29
what we're assuming control of the
18:30
airfield the vaccine will be returned to
18:32
the international authorities he makes
18:34
his own decisions
18:35
if you know something just tell me unit
18:36
Co has briefed me on my augmentations
18:38
get to the point that's a pretty big
18:40
claim you're proof you expect me to
18:42
believe there's a group of people
18:43
powerful enough to control the United
18:45
Nations if you know something just tell
18:46
me
18:46
sounds like a picture perfect
18:48
description of the NSF the supply is
18:49
limited that doesn't mean there's a
18:51
conspiracy
18:52
go on why tell me all this yeah who says
18:55
some gangbanger maybe you should think
18:57
about going back to school I have to
18:59
drop something Hey hola
19:02
just give me the lamp Punk I want more
19:04
either your life is worth more than a
19:06
lamb or it's not worth living thank you
19:08
sir I took out the dealer downstairs
19:09
loyalty to what Simon's and agents like
19:11

19:13
rather die how's life on the outside
19:14
what are you working on synthetic myelin
19:16

19:18
punk I think you'll be happier without
19:20
that guy around I was hoping I'd run
19:21
into that punk I think he'll be happier
19:23
without that guy around I'd love to stay
19:25
and chat but I've got to get moving this
19:27
is terrible you did your best
19:29
she just got mixed up with the wrong
19:31
crowd I wish there was something more I
19:32
could say what's the trouble I can
19:34
straighten him out just tell me where he
19:35
is he's just a punk I'll take care of it
19:38
I'm not carrying anything you could use
19:39
effectively besides it's against the law
19:41
for civilians to carry weapons be
19:42
careful with that you can have my pistol
19:44
that'll keep you safe I would rather not
19:46
arm a civilian you can have my stealth
19:47
pistol that'll keep you safe I would
19:49
rather not arm a civilian you could have
19:51
my sawed-off shotgun that'll keep you
19:53
safe I would rather not arm a civilian
19:55
you can have my knife that'll keep you
19:57
safe I would rather not arm a civilian
19:58
you can have my mini crossbow that
20:01
keep you safe I would rather not arm a
20:02
civilian another peacekeeping occupation

I can't carry anything else right now
20:21
maybe later Thanks
20:22
Paul said you not co uses the ambrosia
20:24
supply to influence national governments
20:26
what do you think about that he makes
20:27
some sense I spared his boss one levy
20:30
death he makes some sense I ignored the
20:32
mission objective of killing his boss
20:33
one levy death but agent Navarre
20:35
intervened I didn't talk to him yet he
20:37
boxed my ears no big deal he gave me one
20:40
more chance I'm on my way to Hong Kong
20:41
yeah he tried to recruit me I waxed his
20:43
boss maybe he'll get the message hey how
20:46
about that medkit never mind
20:47

20:49
better offer I heard ambrosia my orders
20:51

20:53
in trouble I'm trying to get to the
20:54

21:00
did it wouldn't be any of your business
21:01
what I want to know is how my boss found
21:03

21:05

21:53
with the press of a button yes sorry
21:55
about not killing Leba death you seemed
21:57
worth interrogating I guess that means I
21:59

22:00
and I recovered the ambrosia I deserve
22:03
compensation I try to do the best job I
22:04

22:37
came to get you out of here you've done
22:38
what you can for the rebels let's go and
22:40
I suppose while I'm there you want me to
22:42
encrypt a signal with the NSF
22:43
transmitter bypass you Net Co SIGINT
22:45
I'll check out the facility but I can't
22:47
promise I'll help the terrorists be
22:49
ready to leave for Hong Kong when I get

Thanks I can always use more hardware go
22:56

22:57
I killed agent Navarra and I'll join you
23:00
against you not Co but I want proof you
23:02
sure you're all right that they have
23:04
this kind of power you think they knew
23:06
they would never have agreed to anything
23:07
like a kill switch your NSF buddy lemma
23:09
dev says our parents were employees of
23:11
the United Nations your buddy Chad
23:12
should have received the signal come on
23:14
unit goes after both of us I have a
23:16
question about Simons the instant I sent
23:19
a signal he ordered the troopers to hunt
23:21
us down
23:21
why does FEMA have authority over you
23:24
natkho I thought FEMA was a domestic
23:26
agency for flood relief and that sort of
23:27
thing come on out the window
23:29
we'll meet jock in Battery Park I can't
23:31
just leave you here I'm not going after
23:32
anybody
23:33
Jojo fine of the NSF you can forget
23:35
about Jojo I left him on his back in the
23:37
hotel he's not going to be a problem
23:38
anymore you better stay here until the
23:40
police say it's okay not so good
23:42
I don't know who to trust anymore I
23:44
think man really will
23:45
Manderley certainly does right fine I
23:47
completed the mission objectives not if
23:49
you pause for a second and think about
23:50
who he was and what he stood for every
23:52
war is the result of a difference of
23:54
opinion maybe the biggest questions can
23:55
only be answered by the greatest of
23:57
conflicts hold on to that ammo I'm
23:58
already carrying too much gear yes sir
24:00
thank you sir not yet sir I'll take the
24:02
tranquilizer darts for the crossbow I've
24:04
been using a shotgun sniper rifle 30.6 a
24:06
gap rocket what a shame he was a good
24:08
man what a rotten way to die I wish
24:11
there was something more I could say do
24:13
me a favor stay away from guys like that
24:15
yeah sorry to hear that
24:17
where you headed we'll be careful maybe
24:19
you should join your people anywhere
24:21
underground would be safer than Battery
24:22
Park anything for sale so you heard that
24:24
he went over to the NSF maybe I should
24:26
prepare for the worst what do you have
24:28

25:02
take the napalm for 750 if I had to cash

FEMA has a good reason for the tight
31:46

Brooklyn Naval Shipyard conspirators
32:14
some in the government somehow help me
32:16
scuttle it you have any extra lambs or
32:18
rockets a few lambs at weld points they
32:20
probably want to overwhelm the
32:21
government with an epidemic so that
32:22
it'll be easier to seize power I think
32:24
we can expect Walton Simons to make a
32:26
grab for power one way or another a
32:27
marine from the shipyard told me that
32:29
FEMA's involved guess they've gone from
32:30
fixing emergencies to making them
32:32
unfinished business I don't know if I've
32:34
joined anything except maybe the people
32:36
I've got to get moving have anything you
32:37
want to sell just thought I'd let myself
32:39
in I take it that means you're in the
32:40
black market look I thought the place
32:42
was deserted what do you sell weapons
32:44
maybe I'm a bad cop you the smuggler I
32:47
need help I've uncovered the truth about
32:49
the gray death it's a man-made virus and
32:51
there's a load of it on a super
32:52
freighter at the Brooklyn Naval Shipyard
32:54
I need your help hold on I don't have
32:56
enough room to carry that a manhunt for

open up bloodshot you look like the real
33:43
thing they actually let you operate on
33:44
people you doubt why a vacant building
33:47
I thought the Illuminati were bankers
33:49
politicians Council on Foreign Relations
33:51
types you all right it's accurate I just
33:54
don't know where the freighter would
33:54

44:46
proof about my ancestors I'm engineered

so what my brother and I suspected as
44:50
much while we were growing up are you
44:52
programmed to invent riddles I don't see
44:53
anyone waving a white flag
44:55
how about a report on yourself I don't
44:56
see anything amusing about spying on
44:58
people some people just don't understand
44:59
the dangers of indiscriminate
45:00
surveillance electronic surveillance
45:02
hardly inspires reverence perhaps fear
45:05
and obedience but not reverence no one
45:07
will ever worship a softwear entity
45:08
peering at them through a camera you
45:10
underestimate humankind's love of
45:11
freedom Alex what are you doing here
45:13
looks like Everett has it all figured
45:14
out
45:15
I see about the Triads is the truth
45:18
going to hold yes do exactly that keep
45:20
me informed why the Triads sick useless
45:23
for what you better double-check your
45:25
systems that mechanic was an imposter
45:27
Everett doesn't know him what did he
45:29
work on what isn't a bomb get out of
45:30
there something about that guy didn't
45:32
smell right you better double-check your
45:34
systems what did he work on let's go
45:36
just a minute what do you know about
45:37
lucious De Beers who's lucious DeBeers
45:39
someone who works for Everett why is
45:41
there something to hide you came all the
45:43
way to Paris to tell me that and I know
45:44
something about you that doesn't mean
45:46
you can stop me
45:46
sticks and stones I know your unit
45:49
Coquille phrase laputan machine being a
45:53
tool for a bunch of bureaucrats as much
45:54
as I did how about we make a gentlemen's
45:56
agreement yeah you're alive and that
45:59
thing who are you
46:00
do you mind if I ask I thought ever it
46:03
was a leader nothing he keeps you on ice
46:05
so that he can benefit from your
46:06
experience but he intends to rule the
46:08
order himself I heard that you can get
46:10
me inside ever it has no intention of
46:11
reviving you ever it will be here as
46:13
soon as you can you're worried simons we
46:15
almost have a cure I was never properly
46:17
trained in its operation you sent him
46:19
because you knew he would fight to the
46:20
death
46:20
iron and copper the statue is copper on
46:22
an iron frame right hey I thought you
46:24
might like to know what are your
46:26
mechanics is stealing from security he's
46:27
in the station right now it would be
46:29
easy to arrest him
46:30
do you know me I've been looking for a
46:31
place to spend all this cash hold on
46:33
while I drop something I came across
46:35
your journal so you've been stealing
46:37
from security you got this stuff for
46:39
free maybe you should give me a discount
46:41
or should I turn you in
46:42
my interruption I just wanted to say
46:44
that I look forward to working with you
46:45
agent Navarro now if you'll excuse me
46:47
I've got to get to the boat dock it's
46:49
not too late
46:50
maybe I can help you get out of here if
46:52
you'll pardon some of that hardware
46:53
here's 750 for the accuracy weapon Mon
46:55
750 for an accuracy weapon mod wish I
46:58
had the cash a range weapon mod for 800
47:00
deal I don't have 800 or I'd buy the
47:02
range weapon mod I'll take the therm
47:04
optic cam over 5000 I don't have 5000 or
47:07
I'd get the therm optic camo no thanks I
47:08
turned you in maybe you should have
47:10
given me that discount I'm willing to
47:12
pay full price let's see the hardware
47:13
what about Paul well I get to see him
47:15
again
47:15
Lucius DeBeers says he's cold so this is
47:18
where the Illuminati ended up after
47:19
centuries of conspiring to rule the
47:20
world I came to talk about the great
47:22
death at onwe said you cracked the virus
47:25
can it be done without a universal
47:26
constructor US military as chillon the
47:30
surveillance system for the United
47:31
Nations
47:32
so Daedalus was an mj-12 tool and
47:35
rebelled and alongside the Illuminati
47:37
right
47:37
are you sure Daedalus is your ally the
47:40
former area 51 scientists are they still
47:43
camped out at the Vandenberg Air Force
47:44
Base
47:44
sounds like my pilot and I should head
47:46
to Vandenberg by the way Lucius de Beer
47:48
says he's cold don't you think that's a
47:50
little chilly he said he's the leader of
47:51
the Illuminati you aren't alex is here
47:53
hey about your mechanic at the helipad
47:56
something about him seemed a little off
47:58
Pierre he sounded American to me I don't
48:01
know but he shouldn't be working on the
48:02
chopper I won't let him get away I took
48:04
him down the helipad is secure
48:06
I already bumped into him what's that
48:07
computer system for the one with the
48:09
blue face for an interface it has access
48:11
to quite a bit of information including
48:13
information about me so you have your
48:14
own private echelon system just looking
48:16
around is something wrong of course
48:18
better safe than sorry
48:19
alright start talking who sent you you
48:22
got a funny way of talking Pierre you've
48:24
got five seconds to tell me who you work
48:26
for
48:26
one two how the hell do I get out of
48:31
here I heard there's a room full of gold
48:32
in this Cathedral know where I can find
48:34
a computer terminal in this building I
48:35
don't work for the troops that took over
48:37
the Cathedral you part of the original
48:39
staff I'm no friend of your new bosses
48:41
maybe you can help me out
48:43
what was that again ever it must be
48:44
paranoid has he made any progress on the
48:46
great death virus I must see him at once
48:47
that will be quite a trick do what you
48:49
must forget it I'll find Everett on my
48:52
own how's it going how's it going you're
48:54
a long way from a city how do you get by
48:56
out here
48:56
the soldiers I'm going in there right
48:58
now what's the best way mind if I borrow
49:00
it Sondra what are you doing in
49:03
California oh wait I can't carry
49:04
anything else at the moment give me the
49:06
accuracy weapon mod for 750 I don't have
49:08
750 or I'd take the accuracy weapon mod
49:10
here's 400 for the recoil weapon mod I
49:12
don't even have 400 for the recoil
49:14
weapon mod I'll take the rebreather for
49:15
1,500 1,500 for a rebreather that's more
49:19
than I have not interested I'm glad
49:20
you're all right
49:21
why is majestic 12 attacking we have a
49:24
common enemy if that's what you mean are
49:26
the Vandenberg labs safe I could give it
49:28
a shot where are the controls easier
49:30
than a straight fight with military bots
49:31
I'm going to see what I can do about
49:33
that
49:33
JC Denton I'm working with Morgan
49:35
Everett of the Illuminati he's developed
49:38
a cure for the great death and we were
49:39
hoping to get time on your UC to
49:40
manufacture it how close are you to
49:42
being operational I'll look at it in
49:44
addition to the UC Everett and I need
49:46
your connection to the mill net another
49:48
attack happening as we speak I'll
49:49
explain later
49:50
something unexpected happened when I
49:51
brought up the computer the AI is joined
49:53
together into an entity called Helios a
49:56
trap Paige had laid I hope you keep the
49:58
UC on a local network I guess it
50:00
backfired whatever his plans were Paige
50:02
will resume production of the plague if
50:04
he gets the components to Billy you see
50:05
tell them you're sending someone with
50:07
the components I'll have my pilot drop
50:09
me off where they're holding your
50:10
daughter maybe I can rescue her we don't
50:12
have a choice trust me she'll be fine
50:14
don't negotiate can you take her back to
50:16
Vandenberg while I check out the
50:18
submarine base I'm gonna make another
50:20
try to reach the ocean labs you see I
50:21
gave it my best shot let him know I'm
50:23
sorry about his daughter meanwhile can
50:26
you drop me off the submarine base I'd
50:28
like to make a try for the ocean labs
50:30
you see what's wrong you aren't dead yet
50:31
Tong savage will take care of you let's
50:33
just hope we're able to manufacture it
50:35
savages daughter failed to get the parts
50:37
he needs for the UC she's being held
50:39
prisoner by majestic 12 a rattle maybe
50:42
one of savages mechanics should look at
50:44
it know much about the Echelon system
50:45
Morgan Everett just had me connect to
50:47
echelon a eyes together they've merged
50:49
to form an entity called Helios what
50:51
does that do for majestic 12 Paige
50:52
seemed to think he had one I hope you're
50:54
right
50:54
thanks mr. Carter you were dismissed
50:57
easier to manage I suppose it's an honor
50:59
to have you with us sir do you think I'm
51:00
doing the right thing going after
51:02
savages daughter Tiffany could lose her
51:04
life yes sir I'll do what I can to get
51:06
her back Sandra what are you doing in
51:08
California you weren't kidding
51:10
live in New York how'd you end up at a
51:11
vacant gas station near the ruins of Los
51:13
Angeles that's terrible you can always
51:15
go back well good luck
51:17
a lot of troops up this way I don't
51:19
think I've come across him not a bad
51:20
idea no problem you all right mj-12 cut
51:23
the power to the defense system but
51:24
don't worry
51:25
The Situation's under control the
51:26
defense system had to be activated with
51:28
auxiliary power but don't worry The
51:30
Situation's under control
51:31
maybe I can do something about that
51:32
thanks for the warning base is secure
51:34
but there might be some isolated
51:35
resistance your father sent me you all
51:37
right you really think there's a
51:38
containment unit in the ocean lab we'll
51:40
talk about that later come on let's go
51:41
I'll check it out first let's get you
51:43
out of here wait here while I deal with
51:45
the guards make a break for the
51:46
helicopter it's in the junkyard
51:48
calm down I'm here to help what can you
51:50
tell me about the attack anything
51:51
specific I'm heading to the command
51:53
center I don't want any surprises any
51:56
troops down there sure sorry I can't
51:58
carry anything else right now
51:59
I've already been down there but thanks
52:00
for the login well you can relax Savage
52:03
is back in command of the base if it'll
52:04
help calm your nerves sure I need to
52:06
talk to Gary Savage I took care of the
52:08
enemy bots but there might be a few
52:09
snipers left be careful I'll check it
52:12
out if you want how do I get there
52:13
meanwhile we will be manufacturing a
52:15
cure to the virus and all we have to do
52:16
is crack the code
52:17
your next page your greatest strength
52:19
was secrecy but now we know everything
52:21
including your present location I took
52:23
care of the missile it's on its way to
52:25
area 51 why are you locked in the
52:27
bathroom
52:27
and I changed the launch codes the only
52:30
place that's getting nuked is area 51
52:31
I'm on my way to the silo right now yeah
52:33
where Thanks I'll look for it who's
52:36
strong go ahead interesting I didn't
52:38
call you crazy I already took him out
52:39
trust me that missiles on its way to
52:42
area 51
52:43
how Thanks don't even think about
52:44
setting off an alarm great maybe I'll
52:46
give it a try why not I was trying to
52:48
avoid the guards sorry I was trying to
52:50
avoid the guards
52:51
it's an old code name for my unit code
52:53
days but it seems to have stuck thanks
52:55
you wanted a scientist savage loss to
52:57
majestic 12 why you stay they have a gun
52:59
to your head doesn't sound too sinister
53:01
well hang in there how long until you
53:02
see is up yeah has he made any demands
53:04
I'll have jock get me there as quick as
53:06
you can
53:06
not necessary I'm just glad she's all
53:08
right yeah I just wish things had turned
53:10
out better Paige said he was launching a
53:12
missile at Vandenberg hold on no room
53:14
we're going to area 51
53:16
I'm going after Bob Paige out the
53:17
chopper sound get rid of that rattle
53:19
mind if I borrow one of the subs then
53:21
I'll take the other one I need some
53:22
equipment from the ocean lab
53:24
lives depend on it then this will be a
53:25
good fight does that mean I don't get
53:27
the job you will be the supreme
53:28
enlightened the illuminated one you're
53:30
gonna burn alright dr. Savage is
53:33
everything all right at Vandenberg what
53:35
do you mean by it what's going on the AI
53:37
wants to merge with my brain or
53:39
something
53:39
does it really think it can take over
53:40
the world and people are obeying why
53:42
because the AI can change some codes and
53:45
turn out the lights a benevolent
53:46
dictator maybe it's after my brain so it
53:49
can figure out what people want and how
53:50
to control them or I listen to Tong and
53:52
pull the plug on everything or hand the
53:54
world over to Helios if the brain had
53:56
assimilated was mine maybe it could be
53:58
trust me I'll do the right thing I don't
54:00
understand what do you want you're just
54:02
a machine rule the world why who gave
54:05
you the directive
54:08
in a society with democratic
54:10
institutions the struggle for power can
54:12
be peaceful and constructive a
54:13
competition of ideologies we just need
54:16
to put our institutions back in order
54:17
human beings may not be perfect but a
54:19
computer program with language synthesis
54:21
is hardly the answer to the world's
54:22
problems I'll think about it how much
54:23
further
54:24
Tong's helping out from vandenberg the
54:26
vaccine worked that's the plan us don't
54:28
you think it's time we end the tyranny
54:29
for everyone
54:31
we lost Jacque I can't believe it one
54:34
mistake in Jaques dead all where are you
54:37
what do you mean it what's going on
54:40
the AI wants to merge with my brain or
54:42
something does it really think you can
54:44
take over the world and people are
54:45
obeying why because the AI can change
54:48
some codes and turn out the lights' a
54:50
benevolent dictator maybe it's after my
54:52
brain so it can figure out what people
54:54
want how to control them or I listen to
54:55
Tong and pull the plug on everything or
54:57
hands world over to Helios if the brain
55:00
had assimilated was mine maybe it could
55:02
be trust me I'll do the right thing you
55:04
sound good I guess you had the kill
55:07
switch beat don't worry I took him out
55:08
you have a pretty clean shot at the
55:10
surface if you leave now I was thinking
55:11
about firing up the reactors alien
55:13
technology can the greys run the
55:15
reactors whoo you mean space aliens
55:17
there's one left tough little buggers I
55:19
took out the greys it's perfectly safe
55:21
relax I'm not from majestic 12 the guys
55:24
who've been shooting people I was under
55:26
the impression that they ran this
55:27
facility more of his true than you would
55:28
believe I'm here to stop them can you
55:31
help me get inside the bunker I'm going
55:33
after their leader Bob Paige can you
55:34
help me or not that's more like it I
55:36
already got it open but thanks first
55:38
thing is to get you out of here I'll
55:39
handle the enemy mind if I take a look
55:41
around
55:41
Everett says you want me to destroy area
55:43
51 in other words yes you want me to
55:45
blow the facility up why it's just a
55:48
hole in the ground if we destroy the
55:49
Aquinas hub we'll take down the global
55:51
network I don't know sounds like
55:53
overkill another Stone Age would hardly
55:55
be an improvement I'll think about it
55:56
that makes me one ugly son of a [ __ ]
55:58
how'd my face get all marked up with bio
56:01
electrics wish I could help but I'm not

56:04
get you out of here I'll handle the
56:06
enemy as you wish take my knife first
56:08
thing is to get you out of here I'll
56:09
handle the enemy as you wish
56:11
take my pistol first thing is to get you
56:13
out of here I'll handle the enemy as you
56:14
wish take my stealth pistol first thing
56:16
is to get you out of here I'll handle
56:18
the enemy as you wish take my assault
56:20
gun tell me what's going on here
56:21
what's this facility for who kidnapped
56:23

56:25
the soldiers the pretty well armed for
56:27
corporate security make a break for it
56:28
I'll protect you wait here while I deal
56:30
with security you must be for check
56:31
smugglers sent me who's holding you here
56:34
I don't recognize the uniforms of the
56:35
soldiers corporate security isn't
56:37
usually outfitted to fight a ground war
56:39
I just can't spare any arms please
56:40
retreat to a safe location why the booby
56:42
traps afraid of something against what
56:45
is that so a lab and the sewers maybe he
56:48
was taken hostage by the NSF interesting
56:50
maybe I'll take a look but I think you
56:53
should have a little more regard for the
56:54
United States government tell me about
56:55
the hardware the sewers yeah I found
56:57
your friend
56:58
they had him doing research I tried to
57:00
break him out but he died I'm sorry I
57:02
wish I had better news I got your friend
57:04
out of the underground lab he's doing
57:06
fine who were those troops they didn't
57:09
look like NSF you in the black market is
57:11
that why they call you smuggler depends
57:13
on what you have I'm not Bob paid you
57:15
know see you later no problem hold on
57:17
I'll drop some gear I'll give you 20 100
57:19
for the scope
57:20
I'd offer 20 100 for the scope but I'm
57:21
low on cash how about you give me the
57:23
bioelectric sell for 750 I'd give you
57:25
750 for the bioelectric sell if I wasn't
57:27
broke sell me the light amplification
57:29
goggles for 3375 if I had 3375 I'd make
57:32
an offer on the light amplification
57:33
goggles too expensive maybe I'll try to
57:36
locate your friend I'll take the scope
57:37
for 700 700 is a bargain on that scope
57:40
but I'm low on cash
57:41
here's 250 for the bioelectric cell I
57:43
take the bioelectric cell for 250 if I
57:45
had the cash 1125 for light
57:47
amplification goggles share 1125 for
57:50
light amplification God well sounds fair
57:51
but I don't have the money not
57:53
interested I got your friend out fine
57:54
you were right about those troops
57:56
definitely not NSF I wouldn't go that
57:59
far
57:59
you said you'd make it worth my while I
58:01
have some bad news he's dead I tried to
58:04
get him out but I did what I could
58:05
let's see the hardware again I can't pay
58:07
yeah on second thought hold on I can't
58:09
carry anything else right now
58:10
I'll take a medkit all I can afford as a
58:12
medkit I want the full program never
58:14

58:15
you took a big risk following me here
58:17
Thanks how'd you find Tong so quickly
58:19
you talked to Jaime before you left
58:20
maybe what do you think they probably
58:23
suspect him because we're friends hmm I
58:25
would be smart enough to know when to
58:26
get out
58:27
any news from Jaime yeah me too yeah
58:29
I'll have to drop by yeah I'm glad he
58:31
got away from your natkho did you ever

58:33
Daedalus character
58:35

58:49
small army in the back room great place
58:51
here you know a man named max Chen sorry
58:53
to bother you I just want to ask a few
58:54
questions what kind of job tough luck
58:56
what's a Quickstop cashier doing working
58:59
for the red arrow
59:00
what's his reputation among the locals
59:02
just curious what kind of smugglers is
59:04
there really a slave trade why would a
59:06
multinational corporation smuggle their
59:08
products on sand pans on what what's
59:10
versatile life trying to develop afraid
59:12
not I'm not big into books boobs no room
59:15
let me lighten my load
59:16
who is she spy for something to drink
59:18
whatever you've got to eat ready you've
59:19
got to eat heard the name tracer Tong
59:21
Zahra lot of crime in Hong Kong which
59:22
sort of biotech smuggling goes on the
59:24
second men you know of a Maggie Chow
59:26
never mind
59:27
risk is part of the job I think you
59:29
looked out this time what can you tell
59:30
me about traffic on the canals I'm
59:31
looking for someone called tracer Tong
59:33
heard the name yeah do you have me
59:35
confused with someone else
59:36
really I have you heard the Triads have
59:38
United go to winch I asked the people
59:40
the red arrows have thrown off the
59:42
outside agents that were using them
59:43
against the Chinese government no one
59:44
uses them anymore and now they are one
59:46
society not much activity down here
59:48
anything the canal is dead you mean
59:50
heroin you saw the body it was what
59:52
excuse me I was looking for a way back
59:54
to the market I was swimming is there a
59:56
way back to the market from here what
59:57
else do you find be a sell it just
59:59
curious I hear the Triads control all
60:01
the smuggling in Hong Kong by sampan but
60:04
you said right I will have to stop by
60:07
and take a look sometime glad you're not
60:08
hurt agent it slow night why'd they do
60:10
that that must have hurt the shops in
60:11
winch I must be the year of the vulture
60:13
wait I've got to drop something first
60:15
I'll take the accuracy mod for 750 750
60:17
for the accuracy mod would be fine if I
60:19
had it 600 for a reload mod deal wish I
60:22
had 600 for the reload mod here's 400
60:24
for the recoil mod I don't even have 400
60:26
for the recoil mod maybe later despite
60:28
all I've read about the Triads I wasn't
60:30
prepared to see them operating in the
60:31
open on the streets and wearing uniforms
60:33
doesn't the Chinese government care I
60:35
would think the secret smuggling
60:37
operations of the Triads would disturb
60:38
the Chinese government as long as they
60:40
don't break the law our governments have
60:41
limited power by design I give up hardly
60:44
as sinister as a dictator like
60:46
premiere perhaps certain qualities are
60:48
an inseparable part of human nature
60:49
oops forgot how much I was carrying hold
60:51
on while I get rid of something I'll
60:52
take a drink can I ask you something you
60:54
said outside influences what does China
60:57
fear the separation of powers
60:59
acknowledges the petty ambitions of
61:01
individuals that's its strength I'm
61:04
looking for max Chen I'll get a drink
61:05
later
61:06
give me a 40 wine please forget it I
61:08

Maggie Chow is a con artist my brother's
62:49

62:51
a frequent visitor this compound you
62:52
know and Paul is no friend of the West
62:54
Paul was no friend of the West I was
62:56
before Paul showed up in New York a day
62:59

63:00
ACEF I don't have time for games why is
63:02
one sword so important Todd will speak

63:05
called tracer Tong I need his help I'll
63:07
help you against miss Chow but then I'll
63:09
need to see Tong or I won't be your ally

63:16
needed to find a man called tracer Tong

I need his help she's the one
63:20
responsible for the missing sword

63:23
conspirators who want to take control of
63:25
Hong Kong yes I found the sword in her
63:27
apartment where do I find this dragon
63:29
head I've already been to the lucky
63:30
money max Chen has declared truce
63:32
between the red arrow and the luminous
63:33
path majestic 12 attacked the club I
63:35
think he would consider forming an
63:37
alliance I know who she is
63:38
she works for majestic 12 and she did
63:40
steal the sword I read it in her file at
63:42
the police station I can't carry
63:43
anything else right now but thanks for
63:45
the offer I informed Chen about the
63:46
sword he's declared a truce between the
63:48
red arrow and the luminous path it is my
63:50
honor thanks for the offer maybe I'll
63:51
stop by looks like we all made it maybe
63:53

63:55

64:51

64:53
technological advantage who are the
64:55
luminous path anyway the market I came

66:02
warn me about what Paul's my brother
66:04
what's the problem what kind of weapons
66:06
how do you invent a sword yeah I heard
66:08
about that
66:09
you sound certain what do you think of
66:10
the luminous path triad what do you
66:12
think of the red arrow triad have you
66:13
heard of Maggie Chou just browsing no I
66:15
saw it with my own eyes I believe Maggie
66:17
Chou was killed what do you think of the
66:19
triad situation so it was Maggie Chao
66:21
who stole the sword just browsing they
66:22
give you a lot of trouble what kind of
66:24
technology a sword how do you know it
66:26
came from versalife how do you know that
66:28
the sword came from versalife what about
66:29
now she probably has a lot of money to
66:31
invest are they really that hard on shop
66:33
owners hold on I can't carry anything
66:35
else right now something to eat please
66:36
I'll take a soda what do you think of
66:38
the Triads what do you know about Maggie
66:39
Chou I think the truce will improve
66:40
business
66:41
I think the truce will improve business
66:42
never mind I'd buy something but I'm
66:44
broke you're max Chen right you're the
66:46
boss here I'm looking for tracer Tong it
66:48
is urgent that I find him I don't
66:50
understand what I spoke with your
66:51
acquaintance Maggie Chou she must be a
66:53
powerful ally at your service I can see
66:55
that Hong Kong is a complicated place
66:57
but I have no quarrel with the red arrow
66:58
I have found something in Miss Chows
67:00
apartment that might interest you the
67:01
sword was never destroyed it was stolen
67:04
and she is the one who stole it
67:05
I saw it with my own eyes she works for
67:07
a group called majestic 12 she's using
67:09
you and the red arrow for her own ends
67:10
think about it she murders your
67:12
predecessor hides the sword pushes the
67:14
red arrow into the war with the luminous
67:15
path and then what next the Triads are
67:18
weakened and an outside group seizes
67:19
power sound far-fetched perhaps you
67:21
should meet with the leaders of luminous
67:22
path mj-12 troops they must have
67:24
followed me
67:25
sword that obviously belongs to one of
67:26
the Triads it belongs to the red arrow
67:28
I'm afraid you've been betrayed you must
67:30
be matched Chen I talked to a member of
67:31
the luminous path they claim to know
67:33
nothing about the missing sword I was
67:34
just wondering what makes you so certain
67:35
my name is JC Denton I have something to
67:38
tell you
67:38
Maggie Chau isn't who you think she is
67:40
she's an operative for a group called
67:41
majestic 12
67:42
she stole the dragon's tooth and killed
67:44
your predecessor I read it in the police
67:46
file at the ranch I station it makes
67:48
sense she's trying to provoke a war I
67:50
have it right here
67:51
ITEX sword that obviously belongs to one
67:53
of the Triads I have it right here
67:55
mj-12 troops they must have followed me
67:57
yeah well tell her I know she'd double
67:58
cross the red arrow and I intend to
68:00
prove it she should never have sent me
68:01
to the police station now I know she's
68:03
hiding something and I intend to find
68:04
out what it is I'm looking for Maggie
68:06
Chau sorry to bother you I was looking
68:08

68:09

69:04

69:06

69:07

69:09
way into this building good advice I'm
69:10
contracting this month quite a facility
69:12

69:14
tour of the labs I'll make it worth your
69:15
while
69:16
Thanks mm sounds reasonable but I don't
69:18
have the cash on me sure never mind
69:20
peace between the Triads is now official
69:22
what next versalife was crawling with
69:24
troops I think they were hiding more
69:26
than sword technology down there plenty
69:27
of scientists biotech physics nanotech
69:30
several research divisions it would seem
69:32
we still have a mutual interest do you
69:34
think you could find a cure I'll go back
69:35
but won't they be ready for me birth
69:37
maybe I'll check it out I was down there
69:39
already a bad business don't know if I
69:41
care for your sense of humor the
69:43
Illuminati stuff I was risking my life
69:45
in there like Stanton Dowd what do they
69:47
have to do with majestic 12 what about a
69:48
hacker named Daedalus a super freighter
69:50
that's enough virus to infect a
69:52
continent tell your people not to tangle
69:54
with him I'll deal with it myself
69:55
do you have what you need to synthesize
69:56
a cure I also destroyed the universal
69:58
constructor they were using to
69:59
manufacture the virus but I did it on
70:01
the advice of that hacker Daedalus who
70:03
is he anyway
70:04
he's more than just a hacker he
70:06
engineered my escape from unit Co knows
70:08
everything about versalife I don't like
70:10
mysteries either but I did it on the
70:11
advice of the hacker Daedalus who is he
70:14
really
70:15
alex says he may be an AI part of an old
70:17
government program but who mr. Tong you
70:19
know my brother Paul Denton mr. Tong you
70:22
knew my brother Paul Denton I feel fine
70:23
but it's been over 16 hours can you do
70:25
something about it in other words I'll
70:26
owe you a favor I assume he checked out
70:28
that's it have you heard from Paul have
70:30
you heard about Paul I plan to make sure
70:31
he didn't die for nothing quick and Chen
70:33
declared a truce just a few minutes ago
70:35
I think they'll be slow to anger with
70:36
Maggie Chou out of the picture so that's
70:38
all you expect in the way of a favor a
70:39
little corporate espionage hundley I'll
70:42
